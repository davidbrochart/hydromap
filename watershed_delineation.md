# Watershed delineation in the browser

1. Go to [this link](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/davidbrochart/hydromap/blob/master/watershed_delineation.html).
2. On the map, click on the location of your watershed's outlet.
3. Your watershed should appear on the map. Depending on its size, this can take some time.
4. The GeoJSON description of your watershed opens in a new tab. Save it to a file on your computer.
5. Go to [mapshaper](http://www.mapshaper.org) and select the file you just saved.
6. You can now simplify your watershed's geometry and save it to a shapefile.
