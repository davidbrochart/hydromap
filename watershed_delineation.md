1. Go to [this link](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/davidbrochart/hydromap/blob/master/watershed_delineation.html).
2. On the map, click on the location of your watershed's outlet.
3. Your watershed should appear on the map. Depending on its size, this can take some time.
4. The GeoJSON description of your watershed was downloaded to a file named 'watershed.json' on your computer.
5. Go to [mapshaper](http://www.mapshaper.org) and select the 'watershed.json' file.
6. You can now simplify your watershed's geometry and save it to a shapefile.
